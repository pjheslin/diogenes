    <h1 class="navbar-area">Downloading the PDFs of the <i>Thesaurus Linguae Latinae</i></h1>
    <div class="info-area">
    <p>
      The Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften has generously made the PDFs of the <i>TLL</i> (apart from the most recent fascicles) available for download from its website under an open access license (CC BY-ND-ND).  Diogenes includes links to the correct page of the correct PDF for each Latin word it encounters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The BAdW originally stated a preference for users to download the PDFs from its own website, even though the license permits free redistribution. Accordingly, earlier versions of Diogenes included a script that downloaded each of the 58 fascicles from the BAdW website.
    </p>
    <p>
      That script proved impossible to maintain, as the PDF files were moved to different locations on the BAdW website, had their names changed, and finally were moved to secure (https) URLs.  The request to download the files directly from the BAdW seems to have disappeared from its website, so I am providing here a link to a Google Drive folder containing the PDFs, as permitted by the license.
    </p>
    <h2><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EfwOhoH9eefS_hVbodLxd7-ee5sg1nNr?usp=sharing">Click Here to Download</a></h2>
    <p>
      When you click on the link above, you will be taken to a Google Drive folder containing the PDFs.  To download them all, click on the downward-pointing arrow next to the “tll-pdfs” heading.  This will show a “Downloads” option (as shown below), which should permit you to download them all (over 6GB in total) with one click.

    <h2>Unzipping the Downloads</h2>
    <p>
      Google Drive usually splits the download into several (e.g. 4) zip files.  First it prepares the download, and then all of the zip files begin to download simultaneously. When all of them have downloaded, go to your Downloads folder and click on each file to unzip.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happens next depends on your computer and operating system.  You may have been given the option to merge the contents of the unzipped files together. If you selected that option, all of your PDF files are in a single folder and you can move on to the next step.
    </p>
    <p> Otherwise, you might have a separate folder with the contents of each zip file.  For example, you might have folders named “tll-pdfs”, “tll-pdfs 2”, “tll-pdfs 3” and “tll-pdfs 4”. In this case, you need to carefully copy the PDFs in each folder into a single folder containing all of the PDFs.
    </p>
    <h2>After Downloading</h2>
    <p>
      Move the single folder with all of the TLL PDFs to some convenient location on your computer. Go back to Diogenes and indicate the location of that folder via the File menu: Set Folder Locations.
