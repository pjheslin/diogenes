    <h1 class="navbar-area">Downloading the PDFs of the <i>Thesaurus Linguae Latinae</i></h1>
    <div class="info-area">
    <p>
      The Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften has generously made the PDFs of the <i>TLL</i> (apart from the most recent fascicles) available for download from its website under an open access license (CC BY-ND-ND).  Diogenes includes links to the correct page of the correct PDF for each Latin word it encounters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The BAdW originally stated a preference for users to download the PDFs from its own website, even though the license permits free redistribution. Accordingly, earlier versions of Diogenes included a script that downloaded each of the 58 fascicles from the BAdW website.
    </p>
    <p>
      That script proved impossible to maintain, as the PDF files were moved to different locations on the BAdW website, had their names changed, and finally were moved to secure (https) URLs.  The request to download the files directly from the BAdW seems to have disappeared from its website, so I am providing here a link to a Google Drive folder containing the PDFs, as permitted by the license.
    </p>
    <h2><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EfwOhoH9eefS_hVbodLxd7-ee5sg1nNr?usp=sharing">Click Here to Download</a></h2>
    <p>
      When you click on the link above, you will be taken to a Google Drive folder containing the PDFs.  To download them all, click on the downward-pointing arrow next to the “tll-pdfs” heading.  This will show a “Downloads” option (as shown below), which should permit you to download them all (over 6GB in total) in a single zip file with one click.

    <h2>After Downloading</h2>
    <p>
      Unzip the files you have downloaded and put the resulting folder of PDFs in some location on your computer. Go back to Diogenes and indicate the location of that folder via the File menu: Set Folder Locations.  Make sure to point to the location of the unzipped folder containing the PDFs, not the zip file.
